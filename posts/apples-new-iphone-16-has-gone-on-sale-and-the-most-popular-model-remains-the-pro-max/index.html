    <h2 class="title">Apple’s new iPhone 16 has gone on sale, and the most popular model remains the Pro Max</h2>
    <div class="post_content">
      <p>Apple’s latest iPhone 16 series has officially opened for pre-order at 8 PM today (September 13), and the first models will be available on September 20.</p>
<p>A large number of iPhone 16 models have already sold out shortly after they went on sale. However, Apple’s official website and Apple Store Tmall flagship store will not stop sales, and consumers can still place orders, but the delivery time will be extended.</p>
<p>Based on the current shipping delays, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is still the most popular version of the year. Among the four colors, although the desert color titanium version has some controversy, as the main color of this year, its storage configuration has generally the longest schedule time. In the Apple Store’s Tmall flagship store, the Desert color of 256GB, 512GB and 1TB must be shipped within 54 days of payment.</p>
<p>In contrast, the popularity of the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus remains low. Although it has been on sale for three hours, the first model is still available on the official Apple Store, only the returned white version has a one-week shipping delay.</p>
<p>For those who didn’t get their hands on the first model, rushing to use the new iPhone 16 May require a markup from scalpers, but that doesn’t make much sense. In fact, even if the official channel orders are scheduled later, Apple may ship ahead of schedule and have the opportunity to receive the phone earlier.</p>
<p>So, which iPhone 16 series users should upgrade, 16 vs Plus and Pro vs Pro Max how to choose?</p>
<p>Although the upgrade of the standard version of iPhone 16 still has some regrets, such as not supporting the ProMotion adaptive refresh rate screen, compared with the upgrades in recent years, the improvement of this generation of iPhone 16 is actually relatively large. The A18 chip and 8GB running memory ensure that its performance will not fall behind in the next few years, and Apple’s smart functions can be directly used after landing in China, and the new shooting button is also arranged. In general, although there are some small regrets, but Apple in order to attract users to upgrade, this generation is also taken out more sincerity.</p>
<p>So if you’re still using an iPhone 12 or older and you’re struggling to use your phone, upgrading to an iPhone 16 is a good option. But if you already have an iPhone 13 or a newer model, there may be no rush to switch. Unless you feel that your current iPhone is no longer enough for your needs in terms of battery life, photography, performance, or storage.</p>
<p>For users with less extreme video and performance requirements, the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are actually enough, and the Plus has the advantage of a larger screen and longer battery life. It is worth noting that the popularity of the iPhone 16 Plus is relatively low, under the same storage version, the price difference between Plus and Pro is 1000 yuan, many users would rather spend 1000 yuan more to buy a higher-end Pro model, or choose a lower storage Pro version of the same price.</p>
<p>For those who have a sufficient budget, if they are hesitant between the iPhone 16 Pro and the Pro Max, the choice is relatively simple. The two models are identical in basic configuration, with only differences in screen size and battery capacity. The Pro Max benefits from a larger screen and longer battery life. If these two things are important to you, then choose Pro Max; If you are more focused on grip, you can prioritize the 16 Pro.</p>
