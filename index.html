First, the bank believes that the global economy is entering a period of slower growth. Second, the bank expects interest rates to rise over the next few years, which will make it more expensive for companies to borrow money and invest in growth. Third, the bank believes that valuations of stocks are currently elevated, which means that there is less room for upside.</p><span class=hellip>&mldr;&mldr; <a
